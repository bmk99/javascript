Hello, I am Madhu Kiran from Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh. I have 1.6 years of experience as a MERN full stack developer and am currently working at Brightcom Group. I graduated from KSRM College of Engineering with a degree in Civil Engineering in 2021, achieving a CGPA of 7.44.

At Brightcom Group, I developed a social media web application using MERN technologies. The application features image posting, emoji-based likes, nested comments, friend requests, and login functionality using JWT tokens. I successfully integrated a friend-restricted chat feature using Socket.io and utilized Cloudinary for image storage.

My technical skills include React.js, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and a basic understanding of MySQL and MongoDB. I'm passionate about building responsive and user-friendly web applications and am always eager to learn and implement new technologies.
